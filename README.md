# BO3-Graphical-Improvement
This mod sets /r_lodbiasrigid to -1000 (increases draw distance/level of detail), /r_modellodbias to 10 (model level of detail), /r_dof_enable to 0 (disables depth of field/distance blur) and enables the console. 

Why? The normal draw distance in BO3 is horrible. Load up into Origins, go to the excavation site, look towards Generator 5, and slowly back away. Also, go under the excavation site and look at the arch by the gramophone. Yeah, that's why lol. This solves the problem regarding the horrible draw distance, optimization and "pop-ins" in some maps at the cost of a few FPS (negligible amount).

You can also parse the source scripts with your own custom mods if you so desire.

Keep in mind, the commands /r_lodbiasrigid and /r_dof_enable are both cheat protected and can be changed only by using this mod or /developer 2 (can cause problems). The command /r_modellodbias is not cheat protected and can be changed anytime, however mod subscribers figured it would be a nice addition.
